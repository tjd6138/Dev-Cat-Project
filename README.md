Chester County Bands Website


Overview:
Our website for the Chester County Bands is the one stop for information about High School and Jr. High Band and Color Guard. Our website has information by tab as needed:
The home tab, for a slideshow of featured images;
The upcoming events tab, for a calendar of important events (since our original functional calendar stopped working and wouldn’t resize due to other resize implementation conflictions we haven’t had time to fix). 
The gallery tab, which has images from the band and color guard events as well as the bio of George Gregory, the photographer as he is seperate from the school staff. (We have his permission to use his images and give credit to his content.)
 The fundraising tab, for updating and allowing people to fund the band program and help pay for equipment and other necessities. 
The contact us tab, for emailing staff and keeping in touch with those in charge (and later for filling out documents like health and contact information.
 
Color:
We have been consistent with both the color scheme the client has implied for us to use, the colors of the band, and the school. We are also very supportive of these color choices, for they also play key roles in the psychological aspect of the site.
 https://www.fatrabbitcreative.com/blog/psychology-of-black-and-white-and-what-they-mean-for-your-business Black represents professionalism, and also allows us to use white font. This keeps our page looking clean and our text legible.
https://www.fatrabbitcreative.com/blog/psychology-of-black-and-white-and-what-they-mean-for-your-business White also has a similar explanation as black. It supports high contrast viewing and less strain while reading. This color also symbolizes openness and peacefulness. Lastly, this color is one portion of the band and school colors. https://www.fatrabbitcreative.com/blog/psychology-of-the-color-blue-and-what-it-means-for-your-business Blue psychologically represents loyalty, as why it is also a school color and choice of the client.
https://www.colorpsychology.org/gray/ Grey was used to signify the difference between the linked emails and normal text, that is the only purpose it serves. Blue grey, in the copyright, was used to not sway as far from the color scheme as the linked emails, as to avoid the idea that the copyright is linked.
(The only reason for using green is to find headers since this is technically excluded from the actual project.)

Font:
The font used was similar to the font on the band shirts. The font of the site is a sharp, confident font. We also used a rounder font for the rest of the project, for reading purposes.

Background:
Referring to the use of our colors, the black background is used for both contrast and clarity, as well as a neutral color that matches everything. So, no matter what colors are used within, white will always contrast it to the max and it won't look "messy" with "out of place" colors.

Design Psychology:
The layout focuses on aspects of most wanted content and less words, first. Images are used before any other information is shown as we try to display both visually appealing and accurate content. We try to keep simple ideas so that it doesn’t get to boring or strenuous finding information the client or viewer is looking for. If they are still interested in the subject, they can read on and find out more, or continue to other features of the site with the nav bar. We keep the pages loaded with information, but not too much so that it looks gaudy. If information gets too clouded, we have varied separation and portions so it is legible and interesting. The client has specified a series of requirements such as:
	-a calendar
	-a logo
	-gallery
	-remind app
	-documents
	-the title
But unfortunately, we are only as technically advanced as novice web design students can be and as efficient as we can be in one class period. This means we cannot have all of the features implemented that the client wants in this project yet. They are also very busy, so we also don’t have all of our information. Though, hopefully in the future, we can have all of the client’s wants and needs filled for when we get a domain and publisher for the website our client actually wants to use to represent the band.
