Overview:

Our website for the Chester County Bands is the one stop for information about the High School and Jr. High Bands and Color Guard. Though all focus on Chester County Bands, the result of each tab was supported by a methodic and unique thought process developed within our team.


Home: Featured Image Slideshow:
Because we had not been provided much content to display on the home page, our team decided to have something visually appealing yet challenging while showcasing something to compensate for the lack of available content.

Upcoming Events: Calendar (represented by table):
Our team originally had a stylized calendar planned in reference to a CodePen we had seen involving JavaScript. We had decided, being a group of coders with only one year of experience, that our plan had the potential to be too difficult to refine before the competition deadline. Though not originally what we had in mind, we are still proud of our decision to keep the calendar simple.

Gallery:
The gallery consists of numerous pictures highlighting proud moments of Chester County High School Band’s participation in competitions of the previous Band Season and a short bio for the photographer George Gregory. Our team chose to display the gallery in a uniform way, being sure to keep the height of all rows consistent. We’ve applied this consistency to the bio of Mr. Gregory, being sure it is noticeably different while avoiding stealing the focus from the images. Again, we were conflicted by lack of content. In this case, all pictures we could scavenge were only of High School. There was no other option than to display what we had available. Before the site is displayed for the public, we will update the gallery to include pictures of all bands.

Fundraising:
Because fundraising is a vital way to fund our band, our client requested we make a fundraising page to inform those who support our band to get something in return for their support. The layout was made to simply display general information about opportunities to support our band such as time frame and product.

Contact:
Our contact tab contains contact information to all of the authorities who help make our bands run smoothly. We plan to later include documents containing health and contact information forms in this contact page.
 
Color:


We have been consistent with the color scheme the client has requested - the colors of our school. We are very compliant with the requested color choice, for it plays key roles in the psychological aspect of the site.

 https://www.fatrabbitcreative.com/blog/psychology-of-black-and-white-and-what-they-mean-for-your-business Black represents professionalism, and also allows us to use white font. This keeps our page looking clean and our text legible.
 
https://www.fatrabbitcreative.com/blog/psychology-of-black-and-white-and-what-they-mean-for-your-business White also has a similar explanation as black. It supports high contrast viewing and less strain while reading. This color also symbolizes openness and peacefulness. White is one of two school colors.

https://www.fatrabbitcreative.com/blog/psychology-of-the-color-blue-and-what-it-means-for-your-business Blue psychologically represents loyalty, as why it is also a school color and choice of the client.

https://www.colorpsychology.org/gray/ Gray was used to signify the difference between the linked emails and normal text, that is the only purpose it serves. Blue gray in the copyright was used to not sway as far from the color scheme as the linked emails, to avoid the idea that the copyright is linked.


Font:


The font used for the title of the website resembles the font used on the band t-shirts, and it is sharp and confident. We used a rounder font for the rest of the project, for eligibility purposes.


Background:


Regarding colors, the black background serves as a neutral color that matches everything while keeping contrast and clarity.


Design Psychology:


The layout focuses directly on aspects of most wanted content. Images are used before any other information, as we try to display visually appealing content first. We try to keep simple ideas so that it is not strenuous for the viewer to find information. If they are still interested in the subject, they can read on and find out more, or continue to other features of the site with the nav bar which stays at the top of the screen when scrolling. We aimed for simplification as not to crowd the screen. To enable easier searching, we have varied separation and portions so it is legible and interesting. The client has specified a series of requirements such as:

	- calendar
	
	- logo
	
	- gallery
	
	- remind app link
	
	- documents
	
	- the title
	
	
But unfortunately, we are only as technically advanced as novice web design students can be and as efficient as we can be in one class period. This means we cannot have all of the features implemented that the client wants in this project yet. When addressing this issue to the client, she agreed that missing features can be added in as our team advances.

Credits:


As the creator of the concept of our website, Mia Osterman took charge of wireframing, information retrieval, creative management - deciding colors, fonts, layouts, and checking/finalizing page presentation. In addition to physical presentation, Mia managed literate presentation. Mia mainly contributed to the about page and gallery page layout code.
Emily Mutter pushed her limits, being the team’s most valuable contribution to CSS and JavaScript code. Emily was our overall problem addressor, ensuring responsiveness after laying down most of the website's base code.
The over all manager of our team, Tiffany Decker, kept everyone on task, confirming that every second of work was managed in a timely manner. One of Tiffany’s most important contributions was the navigation bar. As she was the main mean of communication within the group, Tiffany had often addressed problems to both of the other team members to refine our project. Tiffany tidied code both before and after she uploaded the site to GitHub.
